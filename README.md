#### By **GROUP 10 MEMBERS**

## Description
This Travel Destinations App is a comprehensive web application built with React that allows users to manage their travel bucket list and track their adventures. The application provides a clean, intuitive interface where users can view, edit, and delete travel destinations with detailed information including images, descriptions, planned dates, and budgeted amounts.

The app features a modern card-based layout that displays destinations in a responsive grid, making it easy to browse through saved locations. Users can edit destination details inline without navigating to separate pages, providing a seamless user experience. The application also includes a dark/light theme toggle that respects system preferences and persists user choices.

Key functionality includes smooth navigation between sections (Home, About, Contact), real-time data management through a JSON server API, and responsive design that works across all device sizes. The interface is designed with accessibility in mind and provides visual feedback for all user interactions.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Ensure you have Node.js version 16 or higher installed

### Running the Application
**Option 1: Using hosted JSON server (recommended)**
* Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
* The application connects to a JSON server hosted at `https://json-server-books-2.onrender.com`

**Option 2: Using local JSON server**
* Open two terminal windows in the project directory
* In the first terminal: Run `npm run server` to start the local JSON server on port 3001
* In the second terminal: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
* Update the API URLs in the code to use `http://localhost:3001` instead of the hosted server
* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Known Bugs
Currently, there are no known critical bugs in the application. However, some areas for improvement include:
* Image URLs must be provided manually rather than through file upload
* The application depends on an external JSON server, so functionality may be limited if the server is unavailable
* Theme toggle animation could be smoother on some browsers
* On very slow internet connections, destination loading may take longer than expected
* After adding a new destination, the page refreshes to show the updated list

## Technologies Used
* React 19.1.0 - Frontend framework for building the user interface
* Vite 7.0.4 - Build tool and development server for fast development
* React Router DOM 7.7.0 - Client-side routing for navigation between sections
* CSS-in-JS - Inline styling approach for component-specific styles
* React Context API - State management for theme functionality
* JSON Server - RESTful API for data persistence (hosted on Render)
* Local Storage - Browser storage for theme preference persistence
* ESLint - Code linting and formatting
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+) features including hooks, async/await, and destructuring
